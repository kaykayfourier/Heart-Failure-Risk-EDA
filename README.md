# Heart-Failure-Risk-EDA
Exploratory data analysis on heart failure clinical records dataset.
## Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset, where I break down the variables, study their relationships, and identify patterns that may influence disease risk.
The goal was to practice working with real-world medical data, clean it, visualize it, and draw meaningful observations.
