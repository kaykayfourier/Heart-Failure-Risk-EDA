Exploratory data analysis on heart failure clinical records dataset.
# **Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis**

This project presents a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a heart disease dataset.  
The objective was to examine the dataset, understand the distribution of key medical variables, identify meaningful relationships, and uncover patterns that may influence the likelihood of heart disease.  
The analysis emphasizes clarity, interpretability, and data-driven reasoning.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

The analysis includes:

- Initial exploration and summary statistics  
- Data cleaning and basic preprocessing  
- Univariate and multivariate visualizations  
- Correlation analysis and pattern identification  
- Interpretation of trends relevant to heart disease risk
- An implementation of Logistic Regression Model
- Model evaluation metrics insight to describe the dataset

The notebook is designed to be easy to follow, even for readers who are new to EDA.
